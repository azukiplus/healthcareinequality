                You have been a laborer in Mexico for your entire life, but heard that the USA is a land of economic
                equality, significantly higher wages, and better opportunities.

                <br>
                You are tired of living in an area of
                crime and poverty, and want to improve your situation and your children's future opportunity. You
                take your wife and two young children and travel 400 miles via bus to the US border near San Ysidro, CA.
                <br>
                <br>
                You're not sure what is present in this "land of opportunity," but are excited to see what awaits for

    Unfortunately, Latino immigrants have limited job access in the USA. Statistically, construction is the most common
    profession pursued by Latino immigrants followed by farming & hospitality services. As of 2018, only 26% of Latino
    immigrants had a Bachelor's degree or more education.
    Additionally, those with Hispanic accents are less likely to be hired for entry-level positions and are less
    desirable for managerial promotions.

    Healthcare access is substantially more complicated for immigrants than it is for the average American. "Money,
    because healthcare is not free here... Unless you are coming with refugee or asylee status you can't get Medicaid
    for 5 years except emergency Medicaid, so cost is a big barrier."

    Most undocumented Latino immigrants stress that the presence, as well as the actions, of local police
    agents from ICE and/or CBP are the main deterrence from traveling to clinics to receive healthcare and social
    services.
    "I don't think it's necessarily ICE, I think it is police, particularly the police department. They tend to
    pull people over for minute things like a broken tail light and then if they are feeling particularly
    aggressive that day, they could contact ICE."
