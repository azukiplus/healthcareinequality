    Hundreds of millions of Americans seek medical care each year
  </p>
  <p>
    25% of these individuals are minorities
  </p>
  <p>
    Now imagine you're one of them.

  <p>
    The following are true stories told by real people.

  <p>
    Can you live like they did?

<div id="story-selection">
  <p>
    You have been a laborer in Mexico for your entire life, but heard that the USA is a land of economic equality,
    significantly higher wages, and better opportunities.
    You are tired of living in an area of crime and poverty, and want to improve your situation and your children's
    future opportunity. You take your wife and two young children and travel 400 miles via bus to the US border near
    San Ysidro, CA.
    You're not sure what is present in this "land of opportunity," but are excited to see what awaits for
    you and your children's lives ahead.

    DAY 1: You are able to cross successfully. Now is the start of your new life in America, the land of opportunity!
    You are lucky; you have an uncle that lives in Loma Linda who has offered to house your family for the time being.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="hm2">
  <p>
    DAY 2: You and your family can't live in your uncle's house forever, unfortunately. You need to find a job, and
    fast.
    Your job options are limited, especially since you don't have a vehicle. These are currently your most favorite
    job leads:

    Construction laborer at a contracting corporation

    Line cook at a Temp catering agency

    Unfortunately, Latino immigrants have limited job access in the USA. Statistically, construction is the most common
    profession pursued by Latino immigrants followed by farming & hospitality services. As of 2018, only 26% of Latino
    immigrants had a Bachelor's degree or more education.
    Additionally, those with Hispanic accents are less likely to be hired for entry-level positions and are less
    desirable for managerial promotions.

    Walk to a local street medicine clinic held by LLU students

    Borrow your uncle's car to go to the hospital

    Healthcare access is substantially more complicated for immigrants than it is for the average American. "Money,
    because healthcare is not free here... Unless you are coming with refugee or asylee status you can't get Medicaid
    for 5 years except emergency Medicaid, so cost is a big barrier."
    -[Vanessa, Washtenaw FQHC] (when asked about the expenses linked to receiving healthcare in the states).

  <p>
    You get pulled over because your uncle's car has a broken tail light. The police officer asks to see your
    license and vehicle documents.
    WHAT DO YOU DO?
  </p>
  <p>
    Tell him that you are going to the hospital, and that it is very urgent
  </p>
  <p>
    Tell him that you don't have them on you right now
  </p>
  <p>
    You are ticketed and given an infraction. You are extremely lucky that the officer didn't charge you
    with a misdemeanor.

    Most undocumented Latino immigrants stress that the presence, as well as the actions, of local police
    agents from ICE and/or CBP are the main deterrence from traveling to clinics to receive healthcare and social
    services.
    "I don't think it's necessarily ICE, I think it is police, particularly the police department. They tend to
    pull people over for minute things like a broken tail light and then if they are feeling particularly
    aggressive that day, they could contact ICE."
